# Specification Quality Checklist: 核心技术与方法论画像

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-21  
**Feature**: `specs/002-tech-stack-principles/spec.md`

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- 本 spec 以“能力条目/证据/评估矩阵”为抽象对象，不绑定具体技术栈；具体条目内容由后续 plan/tasks 落地到仓库文档。
